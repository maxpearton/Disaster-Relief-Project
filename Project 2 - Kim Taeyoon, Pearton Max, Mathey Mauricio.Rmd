# Introduction

In response to the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, rescue efforts 
faced significant challenges in locating displaced persons residing in makeshift 
shelters amidst the widespread destruction. With communication networks and 
infrastructure severely disrupted, aid workers struggled to pinpoint the locations 
of those in need amidst the vast expanse of affected areas. The presence of blue 
tarps, used by displaced individuals to construct temporary shelters, served as 
a vital indicator for locating those in need. The problem now wasnâ€™t so much where 
to look as it was how fast these unique locations could be pinpointed amidst a wide 
array of geographical features and other man-made structures that are present in 
high resolution geo-referenced imagery taken from an aircraft. The sheer quantity 
of aerial footage collected on a daily basis deemed it an impossible task for 
the human eye. Aid workers would be unable to search through the thousands of 
images in time to correctly identify the tarps and subsequently coordinate rescue 
operations. To address this critical issue, data mining techniques emerged as a 
promising solution. Automated algorithms that are capable of efficiently and 
accurately identifying these shelters would be deployed on the collected data, 
enabling rescue workers to deliver essential aid in a timely manner. This project 
aims to evaluate various classification algorithms, along with ensemble methods and support 
vector machines to determine the most effective approach for identifying displaced persons within  
the imagery data, with the ultimate goal of facilitating timely assistance to those affected by the 
calamity. 

Our endeavor began with extensive exploratory data analyses to gain a better 
understanding of the underlying characteristics of the data collected by the 
team from the Rochester Institute of Technology. The discoveries made in this 
process informed our methodology in terms of how we manipulated the data, which 
performance metric best served our interests, and how we justify recommending a 
particular model given the task at hand. 

# Data

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

train <- read.csv("~/MSDS/Statistical learning/Project/Part 1/HaitiPixels.csv")
```

We are working with data collected from aerial images. From Table 1, we can
see that the information that we have is class, red, green, blue. In our case,
as what we are trying to predict is if it's vegetation or a makeshift, Class
will be our dependent variable. Red, Green, and Blue are our independent
variables.

From Table 1 we can see that there are 5 categories in the dataset. We are
interested in predicting the "Blue Tarp" category. A first issue that we can
observe is that it is an unbalanced set. Blue tarps represent 3% of the data only.
This means that it would be very easy for any method to ignore this class and it
could achieve a 97% accuracy. This suggests three initial strategies. The first
one is that when splitting the data we will need to take a stratified sample.
This will ensure that the distribution of both training and testing sets
resemble the original one. The second strategy is reducing the number of classes
from 5 to only 2. This will help us focus on identifying blue tarps and not
other types of objects. Finally, is the metric we will optimize for. If we choose
accuracy, it will be very easy for us to achieve an accuracy of 97%. But this
would be at the expense of not correctly identifying any shelters. On the other
hand if we are overly cautious and assign a greater amount of shelters, we could
potentially dilute rescue efforts. A metric that balances the sensitivity and
the specificity is the J-Index. This is the metric we will be using.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE


table2 <- train %>% group_by(Class) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(count/sum(count)*100,0))

kable(table2, caption = "Number of observations per class")
```
```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

train$Class2 <- ifelse(train$Class == 'Blue Tarp','Shelter','Other')
```

Let's explore how does the presence of red, blue, or green determine each class.
As previously mentioned, we will reclassify the data. Blue Tarp will be coded as
Shelter and all the other categories as Other. This will allow us to focus on
identifying only the shelters which is the problem we are trying to solve.

From figure 1 we can see that for red the shelters present most of the values
between ~120 and 225 which allow to differentiate them from other objects. For blue
we can see that shelters don't present low values of blue but they do present
values above 200 which could help differentiate. Finally for greens we observe
a similar behavior where shelter vs other exhibit differentiated behaviors.

```{r}
#| fig.cap: Distribution of color by class
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%

reds <- ggplot(train, aes(x = Red, color = Class2)) + geom_density() + theme_minimal()
blues <- ggplot(train, aes(color = Class2, x = Blue)) + geom_density() + theme_minimal()
greens <- ggplot(train, aes(color = Class2, x = Green)) + geom_density() + theme_minimal()

reds / blues / greens
```

Let's explore if there are any interactions between colors that could help us
identify shelters better.

From figure 2 we can see that there seems to be an approximately linear
separations between blue and red for shelter vs non shelter. This suggests that
methods with linear boundaries might perform well.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Blue vs Red separation
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%
#| dev: png
#| dpi: 300

ggplot(train, aes(x = Red, y = Blue, color = Class2)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal()
```

From figure 3 we can see that while there is a separation between green and
red, it seems to be nonlinear. This because there is an overlaping area where
you would need a U shape function to be able to separe them. And even with that
we might not be able to do so.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Green vs Red separation
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%
#| dev: png
#| dpi: 300

ggplot(train, aes(x = Red, y = Green, color = Class2)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + theme_minimal()
```

From figure 4 we can see that there seems to be a separation between green and
blue. While not exactly linear, it seems it could be approximated as one.


```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Green vs Blue separation
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%
#| dev: png
#| dpi: 300

ggplot(train, aes(x = Blue, y = Green, color = Class2)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + theme_minimal()
```

In comparison to Part 1 of this project, Part 2 includes a far greater quantity of
holdout data. Whereas the training dataset included approximately 63,000 entries,
the eight text files that comprise the holdout dataset consists of a bit over
2,000,000 entries. The newly presented data includes several additional levels of
detail including ID, X & Y coordinates on a map, as well as longitude and latitude
readings. Most notably, the holdout dataset does not explicitly label the three columns
assigned to measure each respective color (Red, Green, and Blue). 

# Description of methodology

We will test 7 different models: logistic regression, linear discriminant
analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbor, penalized
logistic regression, boosted trees, and support vector machine. We will use 10
fold cross-validation to assess the performance of each of the models and decide
on hyperparameter tuning. we will tune the hyperparameters using ROC AUC.
To determine the optima threshold we will use J-Index because it is an
unbalanced dataset. By using J-Index instead of other metric we make sure 
there is a balance between sensitivity and specificity.

A seed with a value of 1 will be used across the models to
ensure reproducibility. We will have a training set and a holdout set.
We will get a stratified sample by the class variable.
The split will have an 80% - 20% split for training and
testing.



```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE

set.seed(1)

# Set class as factor
train$Class2 <- as.factor(train$Class2)

resamples <- vfold_cv(train, v=10, strata=Class2)
cv_control <- control_resamples(save_pred=TRUE)
```

## Logistic regression

The first model we are going to test is a logistic regression. From table 3
we can see that the AUC ROC is very high.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Formula
formula <- Class2 ~ Red + Blue + Green

# Recipe
rec <- recipe(formula, data=train) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())

# Logistic regression specification
logreg_spec <- logistic_reg(engine="glm", mode="classification")

```

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Logistic regression workflow
logreg_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(logreg_spec)
```

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Define metrics
metrics =  metric_set(roc_auc)

# Cross-validation
logreg_cv <- fit_resamples(logreg_wf, resamples,
                                metrics=metrics, control=cv_control)

```

```{r}
kable(collect_metrics(logreg_cv), caption = "Performance of logistic regression")
```

The next step is figuring out the optimal threshold. As previously mentioned,
we want to maximize j-index to prevent false positives.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Create function to scan thresholds
threshold_graph <- function(model_cv, model_name) {
  performance <- probably::threshold_perf(collect_predictions(model_cv),
                                          Class2, .pred_Shelter,
                                          thresholds=seq(0.01, 0.95, 0.01),
                                          event_level="second",
                                          metrics=metric_set(j_index))
  
  max_metrics <- performance %>%
    group_by(.metric) %>%
    filter(.estimate == max(.estimate))
  
  optimal_threshold <- max_metrics$.threshold[1]
  
  ggplot(performance, aes(x=.threshold, y=.estimate)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(data=max_metrics, color="black") +
    labs(x="Threshold", y="J-Index") +
    geom_text(x = optimal_threshold, y = max_metrics$.estimate[1], 
              label = paste("Optimal Threshold: ", round(optimal_threshold, 2),
                            "|","J-Index: ", round(max_metrics$.estimate[1], 2)),
              vjust = 0.5, hjust = -0.3, color = "black", size = 4) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 1))
}
```

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Optimal threshold for logistic regression
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%

threshold_graph(logreg_cv, "Logistic regression") + theme_minimal()
```

From figure 5 we can see that by reducing the threshold, the J-Index increases to 0.96.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

logreg_model <- fit(logreg_wf, data = train)
```

## Linear discriminant analysis

Next we are going to move to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model.

Before optimizing the threshold, we can see in table 4 a good performance. By finding
the optimal threshold we find that LDA can achieve a J-Index of 0.86.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Define LDA specifications
lda_spec <- discrim_linear(mode="classification") %>%
set_engine('MASS')

# LDA model specification
lda_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(lda_spec)

# Cross validation
lda_cv <- fit_resamples(lda_wf, resamples, metrics=metrics, control=cv_control)
```

```{r}
kable(collect_metrics(lda_cv), caption = "Performance of LDA")
```


```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Optimal threshold for LDA
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%

threshold_graph(lda_cv, "LDA") + theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

lda_model <- fit(lda_wf, data = train)
```


## Quadratic discriminant analysis

Next we are going to move to a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) model.

Before optimizing the threshold, we can see in table 5 a good performance. By finding
the optimal threshold we find that LDA can achieve a J-Index of 0.97.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Define QDA specifications
qda_spec <- discrim_quad(mode="classification") %>%
set_engine('MASS')

# QDA model specification
qda_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(qda_spec)

# Cross validation
qda_cv <- fit_resamples(qda_wf, resamples, metrics=metrics, control=cv_control)
```

```{r}
kable(collect_metrics(qda_cv), caption = "Performance of QDA")
```


```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Optimal threshold for QDA
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%

threshold_graph(qda_cv, "QDA") + theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

qda_model <- fit(qda_wf, data = train)
```

## K-nearest-neighbor

Next we will explore K-nearest-neighbors. For KNN we will define the number
of neighbors K as a tuneable parameter to understand which value would
yield the highest J-Index. We evaluated between 2 and 20 neighbors.

From table 6, we can see that if we aim to maximize the ROC AUC, the optimal number of
neighbors is 20. Other viable alternatives could be 16, 19, 15, or 18. All have
very similar ROC AUC values.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Define KNN specifications
knn_spec <- nearest_neighbor(engine='kknn',
                             mode="classification",
                             neighbors=tune())

# KNN model specification
knn_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(knn_spec)

# Define neighbors parameters
nn_params <- extract_parameter_set_dials(knn_wf) %>%
  update(neighbors=neighbors(c(2, 20)))


# Cross validation
knn_cv <- tune_grid(knn_wf,
                    metrics=metrics,
                    resamples=resamples,
                    control=cv_control,
                    grid=grid_regular(nn_params, levels=20))
```

```{r}
kable(show_best(knn_cv, metric='roc_auc'),
      caption = "Performance based on number of neighbors")
```

We can see that the optimal threshold for KNN is 0.01, achieving a J-Index
of 0.98.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Optimal threshold for KNN
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%

threshold_graph(knn_cv, "KNN") + theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

knn_model <- knn_wf %>%
  finalize_workflow(select_best(knn_cv, metric="roc_auc")) %>%
  fit(train)
```

## Penalized logistic regression

Finally, let's explore the results from penalized logistic regression. In this
case we have 2 tuning parameters. For tuning we used a random grid. The first one is
penalty, this determines the amount of penalty that we will introduce in the model.
The second one is mixture. Which determines the proportion of Lasso vs Ridge penalization
that we will apply. 0 means only Ridge penalization is being used while 1 that only
Lasso. Anything in between is a mixture of both, with lower values having a
higher proportion of Ridge and higher ones a higher proportion of Lasso.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Define penalized logistic regression specifications
penlog_spec <- logistic_reg(engine='glmnet',
                             mode="classification",
                             penalty=tune(),
                             mixture=tune())

# Penalized logistic regression model specification
penlog_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(penlog_spec)

# Define parameters
penlog_params <- extract_parameter_set_dials(penlog_wf) %>%
  update(penalty=penalty(c(-20, -5)),
         mixture=mixture(c(0, 1)))


# Cross validation
penlog_cv <- tune_grid(penlog_wf,
                    metrics=metrics,
                    resamples=resamples,
                    control=cv_control,
                    grid=grid_random(penlog_params, size=20))
```

```{r}
kable(show_best(penlog_cv, metric='roc_auc'),
      caption = "Penalty and mixture tuning",
      digits = 8,
      format.args = list(scientific = FALSE))
```

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Model performance based on regulazation and proportion of Lasso penalty
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%

autoplot(penlog_cv) + theme_minimal()
```

From both table 7 and the figure 9 we can see that the amount of penalty applied
is very small and that it is mostly Lasso.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

penlog_model <- penlog_wf %>%
  finalize_workflow(select_best(penlog_cv, metric="roc_auc")) %>%
  fit(train)
```

In figure 10, we can see that just as with logistic regression, the optimal threshold is
0.04. which would yield a J-Index of 0.97.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Optimal threshold for penalized logistic regression
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%

threshold_graph(penlog_cv, 'Penalized') + theme_minimal()
```

## Boosted trees

Moving onto boosted trees. We have 2 parameters to tune, tree depth and learning
rate. To figure out the optimal parameters, we used random grid search.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE

# Set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Define penalized logistic regression specifications
boosted_spec <- boost_tree(mode="classification", engine="lightgbm", 
                       trees=500, 
                       tree_depth=tune(), learn_rate=tune())

# Penalized logistic regression model specification
boosted_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(boosted_spec)

# Define parameters
boosted_params <- extract_parameter_set_dials(boosted_wf)


# Cross validation
boosted_cv <- tune_grid(boosted_wf,
                    metrics=metric_set(roc_auc,j_index),
                    resamples=resamples,
                    control=cv_control,
                    grid=grid_random(boosted_params, size=20))
```

We can see that the optimal tree depth is 9 with a learning rate of 0.0258.

```{r}
kable(show_best(boosted_cv, metric='roc_auc'),
      caption = "Tree depth and learn rate tuning")
```

In terms of optimal threshold, we see that it is at 0.04 with a J-Index of 0.36.
We know this value is not correct as show in the following graph where we can
see that for a threshold of 0.04 it is 0.9922. We tried debugging the error
but could not find the root cause.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
#| fig.cap: Optimal threshold for boosted trees
#| fig.pos: H
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.align: center
#| out.width: 75%

threshold_graph(boosted_cv, 'Boosted trees') + theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
calculate_metrics_probs('Boosted', boosted_model, train, 0.04)
```

```{r}

boosted_model <- boosted_wf %>%
  finalize_workflow(select_best(boosted_cv, metric="roc_auc")) %>%
  fit(train)
```

## SVM

Moving onto SVM, we are going to test 3 different kernels: linear, polynomial,
and RBF. The tuning parameters for linear will be cost and margin. For polynomial
will be cost, margin, and degree. Finally for RBF will be cost, margin, and
RBF sigma. The tuning for all three kernels will be done using Bayesian tuning.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE

svm_recipe <- recipe(formula, data=train)

#SVM with Linear Kernel
svm_linear_spec <- svm_linear(mode="classification", engine="kernlab",
                              cost = tune(), margin = tune())

svm_linear_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(svm_recipe) %>%
  add_model(svm_linear_spec)

#SVM with Polynomial Kernel

  add_recipe(svm_recipe) %>%
  add_model(svm_poly_spec)

#SVM with Radial
svm_radial_spec <- svm_rbf(mode="classification", engine="kernlab",
                           cost = tune(), margin = tune(), rbf_sigma = tune())

For the linear kernel we can see that with a cost of 0.014 and a margin of 0.198
we get an AUC ROC of 0.998.

## Performance of models on training set

In figure 11 we can observe the ROC curves. As we can see, the only model that
has a slightly worse ROC is LDA. The other models are very similar. Having said
this, we will now move to evaluating the performance of the models on the
holdout set to assess how they perform on unseen data.

## Performance on holdout set

### Determining the correct order of the columns

Now that each of the seven models were built and trained on the initial dataset, we needed to identify the correct validation set. The conundrum here was that weâ€™d been given a holdout set without properly labeled columns corresponding to the red, green, and blue identifiers. As such, we decided to test each of the permutations (six in total) and analyze performance metrics to identify which matchup of B1 through B3 with red, green, and blue is correct. 
A loop was constructed to streamline the six iterations. Initially, we started off with five of the base metrics to distinguish the correct configuration. It didnâ€™t take long to realize that this was more than enough, as the respective metric graphs clearly indicated which color configuration was correct and those that werenâ€™t.

### Assessing which is the correct order

Of the six datasets tested, datasets 2, 4, 5, and 6 had conspicuous irregularities across the metrics measured and were quickly deemed inaccurate. On the other hand, datasets 1 and 3 seemed to indicate a high level of predictive performance from the respective models used. A very interesting observation weâ€™d like to make here is that the primary difference between datasets 1 and 3 were that Red and Green were swapped between B1 and B2. The variable B3 remained consistently tied to the color Blue. Despite this, the two datasets displayed similar levels of performance, with dataset 1 holding an incremental advantage over dataset 3. What this may indicate is that the models are heavily indexing on the blue color in a given image file to classify whether the given location is a blue tarp or a non-blue tarp (shelter or other in our scenario). This makes sense as the entire premise of this project was that shelter locations would most often be indicated by the use of blue tarp rather than any other color.

### Evaluating all models

We first start by evaluating thw models using the ROC of the models. Overall, 
we can say that all models have strong performance on both the training and
holdout set. LDA in particular is interesting as it was the worse performing
model but with the holdout set in improves significantly. Boosted trees is a
model that drops its performance on the holdout set.

                           poly_svm_metrics, radial_svm_metrics)
```

Looking at the performance metrics. As expected, boosted trees has the lowest
J-Index despite having the highest accuracy. This is because we are working
with an unbalance dataset, which means that boosted trees are predicting the
most common class to achieve its high accuracy. QDA is the model that performs
the best on the J-Index. Which is the metric that we prefer to use because of
the nature of the project and the unbalanced dataset.

# Conclusions

1. Best Performing Algorithms 

After conducting cross-validation and analyzing the holdout dataset, it was found
that the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA) support vector machines (SVMs), and XG Boost algorithms
performed exceptionally well in accurately identifying displaced persons living
in makeshift shelters following the Haiti Earthquake. Each of these models exhibited
high accuracy and produced fine ROC curves in the training and holdout set. The
QDA model is one to note with high performance, performing well in all 4 metric
categories, and having the highest accuracy, j_index and sensitivity. The KNN model
and XG Boost rivaled the QDA in terms of accuracy, with all three models having
an accuracy of 0.98. The ROC curves for all the models showed a little bit of
variability between the holdout set and the training set. Overall, the ROC curves
for all models on the training set were superb which indicates strong performance.
The ROC curves for the holdout set did not perform quite as well as the curves on
the training set. All the models produced concrete and solid results. 

2. Why our findings are reconcilable 

The congruence in findings across different algorithms underscores the
reliability and consistency of the analysis. Despite variations in modeling
techniques and underlying assumptions, the overarching goal of identifying
blue tarps and locating displaced persons remained consistent. This compatibilit
reinforces the notion that multiple approaches can be employed synergistically
to tackle complex real-world problems, providing a safety net against model bias
or overreliance on a single methodology.  

3. Algorithm Recommendation â€“ Detection of Blue Tarps 

Drawing upon the strengths observed in the performance evaluations, it is
recommended to deploy a hybrid approach leveraging the SVMs and boosted trees
for blue tarp detection. SVMs excel in capturing complex relationships within
the data and handling non-linear decision boundaries, while boosted trees offer
robustness against overfitting and can effectively handle large-scale datasets.
By combining these complimentary techniques, a more holistic and accurate detection
mechanism can be established, enhancing the efficacy of disaster response efforts.
An argument can be made for the boosted tree model to take priority in this context
due to its higher sensitivity than the SVM models. Representing the true positive
rate, sensitivity would be one of the most critical metrics to focus on because
it ensures that no survivors are missed. This assumption is made possible by the
fact that the scope of this project does not outline resource limitations for
deployable rescue packages. 

4. Relating metrics to this application context 

There are several reasons why the ROC AUC metric is the preferred pathway for
quantifying the modelâ€™s predictive performance. First, this metric gives a holistic
view of the modelâ€™s performance regardless of any threshold. We can objectively
assess the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between the classes across all possible
classification thresholds. More importantly, however, ROC AUC is generally
considered robust against class imbalance. As we pointed out in Part 1 of this
analysis, only 3% of the data pertains to positive blue tarp identifiers. Since
our primary objective is to properly identify emergency shelters set up by people
in need of aid, it is critical to use a metric that evaluates a modelâ€™s ability
to discriminate between classes without being affected by the weight of class
distribution. Realistically, data pipelines in emergency scenarios cannot supply
high-quality aerial images with ideal class distributions. A resilient metric in
the face of varying data volume and quality would be most suitable for this
application context. 

5. Over-indexing on Blue 

The fact that the models performed essentially identically across datasets 1 and 3,
indicates several interesting possibilities regarding our model and the nature of
the data given. For context, the only difference between datasets 1 and 3 was that
B1 and B2 were Red and Green respectively in dataset 1 while the opposite was true
in dataset 3.  Column B3 was consistently assigned to the blue color. This may be
indicative of the fact that our model is not heavily dependent on the specific color
information provided by the red and green channels. The blue channel, on the other
hand, carries most of the discriminative information needed for identifying the
blue-tarp shelters. Itâ€™s also very possible that the model is using other features
derived from the image data such as shape, size, or texture to distinguish the
classes â€“ features that are not sensitive to the specific color details provided
by red and green. Again, a large part of this analysis relies on the assumption
that blue tarp really is the most abundant resource for displaced victims of the
Haiti earthquake relative to tarp of any other color or a material of different
qualities. 

6. Further Research and Improvement 

While the current analysis yielded promising results, avenues for further research
and improvement abound in the realm of automated image analysis for disaster
response. Future endeavors could focus on exploring more advanced machine learning
techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which might be able to
extract and leverage hierarchical features that are less dependent on specific color
channels. CNNs are specifically designed to process data with grid-like topology
(such as images). It eliminates the need for manual feature extraction since it
is highly effective at learning and generalizing from visual data. Additionally,
integrating real-time sensor data and leveraging geospatial analytics for enhanced
situational awareness could significantly augment the effectiveness of disaster
response efforts. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and embracing
innovative technologies, we can continue to advance the frontier of humanitarian
aid and disaster relief.
